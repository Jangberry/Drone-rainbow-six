### main part (*Piece maitresse*)
PLA
density: 100%
### wheels (*roue*)
PLA
density: 15%
### tire (*pneu*)
Any flexible filaments that you can find...
density: depends of your filament... I used 100% because the soft considerate it as void... 
just for you to know: from the software of my 3D printer, it use 130 Kg of PLA but with my flexible filament, it use only ~ 85 Kg
