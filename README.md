# **Drone Rainbow six**

## Description

This is my hugest project, which aims to reproduce the *Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six : Siege*'s drone for real.

I'm french so some french words can be found in the source code (such as variables' name, or in comments) or for the files names... sorry for that, as I started a while ago, it's very difficult to translate all of that...

## Thanks to :

3 of my teachers for their time (For helping me mainly with mechanical issues, but also a bit of code, and for the 3D printer for the first prototype) (I don\'t know if they want to be in the readme, so I hide their namesâ€¦)

### For my 3D Printer (I'm sorry but I don't have nickname for all of them):

- Adrien K.

- Antoine F. (and also for a lot of coding tips)

- Clement C.

- Nicolas R.

- Remy B.

### Other people who helped me

- Neyrox_73 (moral help)

- BenJiZz (moral help)
